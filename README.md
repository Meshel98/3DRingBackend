Configuration Instructions
To properly configure the backend, you need to set up the .env file with the necessary environment variables. This file is crucial for connecting the backend services to the frontend website and other services.

Setting up the .env File
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

makefile
Copy code
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_your_stripe_secret_key
PORT=your_preferred_port_number
SUCCESS_URL=https://your_success_url
CANCEL_URL=https://your_cancel_url
CORS_ORIGIN_1=http://localhost:your_frontend_port
CORS_ORIGIN_2=https://your_additional_cors_origin
CORS_ORIGIN_3=https://your_another_cors_origin
Replace the placeholders (e.g., your_stripe_secret_key, your_preferred_port_number, your_success_url) with your actual configuration values.

Important:

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Your Stripe secret key for processing payments.
PORT: The port number where your backend server will run.
SUCCESS_URL & CANCEL_URL: URLs redirected to after a successful or canceled transaction.
CORS_ORIGIN_X: The origins allowed to access your backend, including your frontend server and any other services that need access.
Installation and Running the Backend
After setting up the .env file:

Install Dependencies

Run npm install to install all required dependencies.

Start the Server
